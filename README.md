# Non-Linear-Regression-to-Multivariable-non-Linear-Regression
- Preprocessing data (dealing with null, ...)
- EDA (Explore Data Analysis): Correlation between features and labels, Linear function or non-linear function, degree 2 or 3,...
- Representation: Data transformation by using Label Encoding / One hot encoding, ...
- Modeling: training and evaluation
- Deployment
## Important Note:
- Degree Choice: if too simple, model would not flexible enough (underfit), if too complicate, model would overfit
